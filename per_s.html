    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <br>
    <p> I'm still learning about myself and my aspiration as a pre-collegiate level teacher. I am hoping to learn and reflect through teaching and travelling.</p>
<!-- <p> I found immense interest in pursuing a career in education in the senior years of my high school. Becoming a high school teacher was my calling, for I discovered gratification in being useful to my peers through helping them in math. In addition, my patient and empathetic nature made me a comfortable person to speak to for classmates all alike. </p>

<p>One word to summarize me would be ‘enthusiastic’. I have an insatiable curiosity for learning. This curiosity is beyond the simple classroom material learnt through lectures and homework. In high school, undergrad, and as a student teacher, I participated extensively in after school activities and developed a wide range of hobbies, mostly in the arts, and leadership skills. I believe in academic excellence. But through extracurricular involvements, I’ve also come to realize the importance of well-rounded personal growth. As an aspiring teacher, I am a big advocate for learning through practical extracurricular activities in addition to classrooms. I believe this gives students a holistic education. Fostering students’ interests and encouraging students to grow as people is deeply rooted in my educational philosophy. I would not be where and who I am today without music and art, and the people that I’ve met through these involvements.</p>

<p>Another vital growth occured in my educational philosophy when I was exposed to computer science in my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo, world-famous for its mathematics, computer science programs. I am an ambitious individual and I do not settle for the bare minimum. I majored in both mathematics and computer science in order to be a knowledgeable computer science teacher. It is unfortunate that computer science education is generally lacking at the high school level, yet organized, logical thinking is so important in developing our brains for problem solving - a critical 21st century skill for success. I want to share with my students the magic of writing code and making things, mentor them to become better problem-solvers, and empower and encourage them, especially girls, to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. With a subject like computer science, I am not satisfied knowing only the basic textbook theory. It is imperative for me to keep my classroom and lessons packed with rigorous theory as well as keeping the material relevant and up-to-date with today’s ever-changing technology industry. But all this requires insight, and the way for me to gain this sort of insight is through continuous learning and hands-on experience. I am an avid coder and designer in my spare time, and I plan to dedicate much of my career as an educator to build and promote computer science education for younger students.</p>

<p>Lastly, I fell in love with seeing the world. Travel makes humbler for there is so much to be learned. It was through the mathematics-teaching program between the University of Waterloo and Queen’s University that I discovered I can build character, leadership, and become a global citizen by expanding my horizon through in-depth travel. I had the fortunate opportunity to observe at a fantastic international school in Atlanta (Atlanta International School) and there I met many worldly, influential teachers who had wealth of knowledge and genuine love of life, and I wanted to be one of these smart, happy people. Then the following year, I was lucky again to land an associate faculty position at a very well-established Canadian private boarding school (Trinity College School). The school has students from over 50 countries, and many of my students were international boarding students – from the Caribbean, South America, China, Germany, UK, etc. They presented different culture, world-view, and varying levels of maturity when it came to dealing with academics and social life in the school. It was fascinating to observe them both in and outside of the classroom (I lived in the school’s residence). These experiences made me rethink about my plan at the time, which was to supply and wait for job openings in the public school boards in Ontario. Becoming a global citizen with acceptance, humility and open-mindedness for all cultures have become a core value to my growth, and I came to see that educating students to become global citizens make them leaders in today's world. Being surrounded by intelligent, worldly people gives us knowledge and vision, which empowers us to do greater things. Therefore, I am so eager to have an opportunity to learn and teach overseas.</p>
