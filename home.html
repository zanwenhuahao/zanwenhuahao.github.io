    <p> Hi there! Thanks for your interested in my teaching <span class="intext-link"><a href = "res.html">background</a></span>! 
      I am a student in my final year at the <span class="intext-link"><a href = "http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a></span>. I will graduate with both my Bachelors of Education (Queen's) and Bachelors of Mathematics (Waterloo) in 2015, after which I will become a certified teacher in Ontario, Canada.  I am currently looking for opportunities to teach overseas or in northern Canada for September 2015! This website is currently in progress and will be filled with exciting content in the short coming days!</p>
